## Priciples in this project:
 * *less code, less bugs:* use fewer lines if possible, remove abstractions that are not required. 
 * *minimal features and complexity:* only implement features that are really necessary for most users 
 * *batteries included/No build process:* the user should only download the repo and update the config file in order to run the app.   
 * *no database:* the application does not have it's own database. The IMAP server is the database.
